**Show Your Work!** is the seminal manifesto for the modern creative. If *Steal Like an Artist* was about how to steal ideas to create, *Show Your Work!* is about how to build an audience by sharing your process.

## 📚 The 10 Core Principles

### 1. You Don't Have to Be a Genius
* **The Myth of the Lone Genius:** Creativity is not the domain of isolated super-humans.
* **"Scenius":** Creativity happens in a "scene"—a collaborative ecology of talent. You don't need to be the smartest person in the room; you just need to contribute.
* **Embrace Amateurism:** Amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They are dangerous (in a good way) and authentic.

### 2. Think Process, Not Product
* **Behind-the-Scenes:** Audiences want to see *how* the sausage is made, not just the finished result.
* **Documentation:** Become a documentarian of your own life. Screen-record coding sessions, photograph sketches, and share drafts. Turn the invisible act of work into visible content.

### 3. Share Something Small Every Day
* **Stock vs. Flow:**
    * **Flow:** The daily feed (tweets, stories, quick posts) that keeps you relevant.
    * **Stock:** The durable content (books, apps, albums) that lasts.
* **The Daily Dispatch:** You don't need a manifesto daily. Share one small thing—a quote, a sketch, or a snippet of code. Over a year, this builds a massive body of work.

### 4. Open Up Your Cabinet of Curiosities
* **Share Your Taste:** You are defined by what you love as much as by what you create.
* **Attribution:** "Credit is the currency of the internet." Always credit sources. Sharing your influences attracts your "tribe."
* **Don't Hoard:** Hoarding knowledge doesn't make you powerful; sharing it does.

### 5. Tell Good Stories
* **Context is King:** A project doesn't speak for itself. You must explain *why* you created it or the struggle involved.
* **Narrative Structure:** Use classic storytelling arcs. Where did you start? What dragon (obstacle) did you slay? What did you learn?

### 6. Teach What You Know
* **The Abundance Mindset:** Sharing "secrets" does not create competition; it creates *authority* and trust.
* **Educational Content:** Tutorials and "how-to" guides are the most shareable forms of content.

### 7. Don't Turn Into Human Spam
* **Listen to Be Heard:** To have fans, you must be a fan. Engage with others genuinely.
* **The Vampire Test:** If consuming someone's content drains you, they are a vampire. Don't be a vampire. Add energy to the conversation.

### 8. Learn to Take a Punch
* **Fear of Criticism:** The fear of judgment stops people from sharing.
* **Thick Skin:** The more you share, the more you get used to taking hits.
* **Trolls vs. Critics:** A critic cares about the work; a troll just wants to upset you. Ignore trolls; listen cautiously to critics.

### 9. Sell Out
* **Money Isn't Dirty:** It is okay to charge for your work.
* **Pass the Hat:** Once you build an audience by giving away value (flow), they will be happy to pay for finished products (stock).
* **Own Your List:** Social algorithms change. A subscriber list is the only asset you truly own. Prioritize it.

### 10. Stick Around
* **The Long Game:** Success is the result of showing up day after day for years.
* **Chain Smoking:** When you finish a project, use the momentum to light the next one immediately.
* **Sabbaticals:** Rest is fine, but the goal is always to come back.

## 💡 The "Writer Genius" Takeaway

> **Perfection is not the goal; connection is.**

Austin Kleon's philosophy destroys the paralyzing idea that you must be "perfect" before you open your mouth. By sharing the messy, imperfect process of your daily work, you don't just build an audience—you find your voice.
